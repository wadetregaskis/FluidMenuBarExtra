import SwiftUI

/// A class you use to create a menubar extra in SwiftUI.
///
/// This is by design similar to Apple's ``SwiftUI.MenuBarExtra`` provided in SwiftUI itself, but with additional functionality and better behaviour (Apple's `MenuBarExtra` doesn't follow macOS standards regarding how it responds to user interaction).
///
/// Typically you use this in your @main body where you spell out your app's various scenes (e.g. WindowGroups, Settings, etc).  e.g.:
///
/// ```swift
/// import SwiftUI
/// import FluidMenuBarExtra
///
/// @main
/// private struct DemoApp: App {
///     @AppStorage("showMenuBarExtra") var showMenuBarExtra = true
///
///     var body: some Scene {
///         FluidMenuBarExtra("Demo", systemImage: "chevron.down.circle", isInserted: $showMenuBarExtra) {
///             Text("Hello, world!")
///                 .padding(20)
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// See also the bundled demo application for a more detailed example.

    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - title: If no image is provided (`.none`), this is the text shown instead.  If an image is provided, only the image is shown but this title is used as the accessibility title (e.g. for screen readers).
    ///   - image: An optional image to use as the icon for the menubar item, in the menubar.  If `.none`, ``title`` is shown instead.
    ///   - isInserted: An optional binding to a boolean that controls whether the menubar item is visible or not.  Typically this is tied to a Toggle in your app's settings, or similar.  Note that this has no effect on the visiblity of the pop-up window (e.g. changing this to false while the window is shown won't hide the window, even though the menubar item itself disappears).
    ///
    ///     Note that this binding is two-way - if the user removes the menubar item from the menubar, e.g. by command-dragging it out, the bound boolean will be set to false.
    ///   - animation: The animation style to use when showing the pop-up window.  By default no animation is used (which is the general default for menus across the board), as users typically don't want unnecessary delays to seeing the content.
    ///
    ///     The exact animation may vary across macOS versions.  In macOS 13, the animation styles are:
    ///       * `alertPanel`:  An energetic "pop"-in effect, with overshoot.  Most modal alerts in macOS present this way.  It is designed to grab the user's attention.
    ///       * `documentWindow`:  A "pop"-in effect.  Most (non-alert) windows in macOS appear this way.  It is designed to be smooth and relatively subtle.
    ///       * `none` / `utilityWindow`:  No animation; the window appears instantly.
    ///       * `default`:  At time of writing this is the same as `none`, but it should never be used as its meaning is implementation-dependent and may change without warning in future versions of FluidMenuBarExtra.
    ///   - menu: An optional menu to be shown if the user right-clicks the menubar item.  This is distinct from the pop-up window shown for left-clicks.  It is uncommon to use this functionality.
    ///   - alignRight: Applies only when the natural location of the pop-up window isn't viable because it would push the window past the rightmost edge of the screen.  The default behaviour (when this parameter is false) is to flip the pop-up window alignment from left edge to right edge (as is the standard behaviour for menus).  If this parameter is true, the window is instead shown as far right as possible (i.e. up against the rightmost edge of the screen).
