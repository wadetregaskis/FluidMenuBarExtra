import SwiftUI

/// A class you use to create a menubar extra in SwiftUI.
///
/// This is by design similar to Apple's ``SwiftUI.MenuBarExtra`` provided in SwiftUI itself, but with additional functionality and better behaviour (Apple's `MenuBarExtra` doesn't follow macOS standards regarding how it responds to user interaction).
///
/// Typically you use this in your @main body where you spell out your app's various scenes (e.g. WindowGroups, Settings, etc).  e.g.:
///
/// ```swift
/// import SwiftUI
/// import FluidMenuBarExtra
///
/// @main
/// private struct DemoApp: App {
///     @AppStorage("showMenuBarExtra") var showMenuBarExtra = true
///
///     var body: some Scene {
///         FluidMenuBarExtra("Demo", systemImage: "chevron.down.circle", isInserted: $showMenuBarExtra) {
///             Text("Hello, world!")
///                 .padding(20)
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// See also the bundled demo application for a more detailed example.

    ///   - title: If no image is provided (`.none`), this is the text shown instead.  If an image is provided, only the image is shown but this title is used as the accessibility title (e.g. for screen readers).
    ///   - image: An optional image to use as the icon for the menubar item, in the menubar.  If `.none`, ``title`` is shown instead.
    ///   - isInserted: An optional binding to a boolean that controls whether the menubar item is visible or not.  Typically this is tied to a Toggle in your app's settings, or similar.  Note that this has no effect on the visiblity of the pop-up window (e.g. changing this to false while the window is shown won't hide the window, even though the menubar item itself disappears).
    ///
    ///     Note that this binding is two-way - if the user removes the menubar item from the menubar, e.g. by command-dragging it out, the bound boolean will be set to false.

    ///
    ///     The exact animation may vary across macOS versions.  In macOS 13, the animation styles are:
    ///       * `alertPanel`:  An energetic "pop"-in effect, with overshoot.  Most modal alerts in macOS present this way.  It is designed to grab the user's attention.
    ///       * `documentWindow`:  A "pop"-in effect.  Most (non-alert) windows in macOS appear this way.  It is designed to be smooth and relatively subtle.
    ///       * `none` / `utilityWindow`:  No animation; the window appears instantly.
    ///       * `default`:  At time of writing this is the same as `none`, but it should never be used as its meaning is implementation-dependent and may change without warning in future versions of FluidMenuBarExtra.
    ///   - menu: An optional menu to be shown if the user right-clicks the menubar item.  This is distinct from the pop-up window shown for left-clicks.  It is uncommon to use this functionality.
    ///   - alignment: Specifies how the pop-up window is aligned relative to the menubar item.
    ///   - screenClippingBehaviour: Specifies how the pop-up window's position is adjusted when it runs up against the edges of the screen.
    ///   - content: The contents of the pop-up window that is shown when the user clicks on the menubar item.
